# SLURM Setup [via SSH]
<img src="./figures/slurm_stdout_3.png" alt="slurm_stdout" align="right" width="600px" style="top:20px">

`jaynes` supports two SLURM launch modes. In the first mode, `jaynes` ssh tunnel through each time when you call `jaynes.run(train_fn)`. In the second model, we setup a `jaynes.server` instance on the SLURM cluster's login node, which we can control via TCP/IP callls. 

Depending on your cluster's admin policy and access configuration, one of these two modes would be more suitable. HPC admins can decide to offer a managed `jaynes.server`  endpoint where they provide token-based access.

In this tutorial, we will provide guide on the [ssh] launch model. For the client/server launch model, refer to [../05_client_server](../05_client_server) instead.

## Getting Started

This example assumes that you can access a remote SLURM cluster via ssh. **First let's make sure ssh works**:

```bash
ssh $JYNS_USERNAME@$JYNS_SLURM_HOST -i $JYNS_SLURM_PEM
```

to do so, you need to configure these in your environment script `./bashrc`

```bash
export JYNS_SLURM_HOST=/*your slurm cluster login node*/
export JYNS_USERNAME=/*your username*/
export JYNS_SLURM_PEM=~/.ssh//*your rsa key*/
export JYNS_SLURM_DIR=/home/gridsan/geyang/jaynes-mount
```

> password login are usually disabled on managed SLURM clusters.

###  

**Second, install `jaynes`.** This tutorial is written w.r.t version: [v0.6.0-rc16](https://github.com/geyang/jaynes/releases/tag/v0.6.0-rc16).

```bash
pip install jaynes==0.6.0-rc16
```

## Managing Python Environment on A SLURM Cluster

Docker are usually not supported on managed HPC clusters, where a shared, NFS offer direct access to common python environments across machines. We assume that you have installed conda, and there is a `base` environment available.

First, let's installl `jaynes`, this is because jaynes use the `jaynes.entry` module to bootstrap the launch after the job starts. In most cases, you want to install all packages in your user space, which is why we pass in the `--user` flag.

```bash
conda activate base
pip install --user jaynes
```

The launch `.jaynes.yml` file contains the following values for configuring the remote python runtime. You can tweak this until your code runs.

```yaml
- !runners.Slurm &slurm
  envs: >-
    LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LANGUAGE=en_US
  startup: >-
    source ~/.bashrc;
    module load cuda/11.0;
    module load anaconda/2020b;
    source activate base;
```

This folder is structured as:

```bash
04_slurm_configuration
├── README.md
├── figures
└── launch_entry.py
```

Where the main file contains the following

### Main Script

```python
import jaynes

def train_fn(seed=100):
    from time import sleep

    print(f'[seed: {seed}] See real-time pipe-back from the server:')
    for i in range(3):
        print(f"[seed: {seed}] step: {i}")
        sleep(0.1)

    print(f'[seed: {seed}] Finished!')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    jaynes.config(verbose=False)
    jaynes.run(train_fn)

    jaynes.listen(200)
```

when you run this script, it should print out

<p><img src="./figures/slurm_stdout_single.png" alt="slurm_stdout_single" width="900px" style="top:20px"></p>

## Launching Multiple Jobs

Just call `jaynes.run` with multiple copies of the function:

```python
#! ./multi_launch.py
import jaynes
from launch_entry import train_fn

if __name__ == "__main__":
    jaynes.config(verbose=False)

    for i in range(3):
        jaynes.run(train_fn, seed=i * 100)

    jaynes.listen(200)
```

And the output should be 3 streams of stdout pipe-back combined together, running in parallel.

```bash
/Users/ge/opt/anaconda3/envs/plan2vec/bin/python /Users/ge/mit/jaynes-starter-kit/04_slurm_configuration/launch_entry.py
