# Practical RL at Scale

This repository is an up-to-date collection of minimal jaynes usage examples. You can mix and match configurations between these included usecases for your particular infrastructure.

## To Get Started

First let's install Jaynes! This tutorial is written w.r.t version: [v0.6.0-rc15](https://github.com/geyang/jaynes/releases/tag/v0.6.0-rc15)

```bash
pip install jaynes==0.6.0-rc15
```

I would also recommend taking a look at [params-proto](https://github.com/geyang/params_proto), which is a pythonic  hyperparameter + argparsing library that makes parameter management declaritive and error-free. We use params-proto and its sweep utility, `params_proto.hyper` in our parameter sweep example. To install params-proto, run

```bash
pip install params-proto waterbear
```

## Table of Contents

For detailed documentation on each usecases, refer to the in-dept tutorial bellow: 

1. [**Multiple SSH Reacheable Machines**](03_multiple_ssh_reacheable_machines)
4. [**Compute at Scale with SLRUM & Jaynes**](04_slurm_configuration)
5. [**Advanced Multi-mode Example**](05_muti-mode_advanced_config)
4. [**SSH Docker Configuration**](01_ssh_docker_configuration)
5. [**EC2 Docker Configuration**](02_ec2_docker_configuration)

In this folder, we provide a collection of example configurations. Each example sits
within its own folder. To run, follow the instruction in the README in that example
project.

## Reporting Issues (on the [Jaynes Repo/issues](https://github.com/geyang/jaynes/issues))

Let's collect all issues on the [main `jaynes` repo's issue page](https://github.com/geyang/jaynes/issues), so that
people can search for things more easily!

## How to Debug

`Jaynes` offer a way to transparently debug the launch via `verbose` mode, where it prints out all of the local and remote script that it generates. To debug a launch script, set `verbose` to `true` either in the yaml file, or through the `jaynes.config` call. To debug in the remote host where you intend to run your job, you can often copy and paste the generated script
to see the error messages.

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Turn on verbose mode**, by setting `verbose=True` in the jaynes call

  ```python
  #! launch_entry.py
  import jaynes
  
  jaynes.config(verbose=True)
  ```

  or 

  ```yaml
  #! .jaynes.yml
  verbose: true
  runner:
  - ....
  ```

2. **Launch**

  ```python
  #! launch_entry.py
  if __name__ == "__main__":
      jaynes.run(train_fn, *args, **kwargs)
   
  # if in SLURM or SSH mode:
  jaynes.listen()  # to listen to the stdout/stderr pipe-back
  ```

3. **Debug** Suppose you have an error message. You can copy and paste the script ran
   by `jaynes`, that is printed out in the console either locally or on the EC2 instance
   you just launched to debug the specifics of it.

4. **Share with Lab mates** When you are done, you can share this repo with others
   who use the same infrastructure, so that they can run their code there too.
