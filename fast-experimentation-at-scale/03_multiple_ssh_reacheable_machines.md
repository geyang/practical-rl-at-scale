# Multiple SSH Reacheable Machines

This folder contains a working example for launching jobs without docker on multiple remote work stations via ssh, with subscription to all of the tty pipe-backs.

result looks like figure to the right: ðŸ‘‰

## Getting Started

This example assumes that you can assess a remote Linux machine via a username and a password.

**First, install miniconda, and python 3.7 \(or below\)**. The cloundpickle module supports python 3.7 and below, which is different from the latest miniconda distribution. So you can install using this url

```bash
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py37_4.8.3-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-py37_4.8.3-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

Follow the instruction, then verify that it as installed successfully via

```bash
conda env
>> *base     $HOME/your-username/miniconda3
```

**Second, install jaynes** and other dependencies you need for your project. This tutorial is written w.r.t version: [v0.6.0-rc14](https://github.com/geyang/jaynes/releases/tag/v0.6.0-rc15)

```bash
pip install jaynes==0.6.0-rc16
```

## Overview of This Example

This folder is structured as:

```bash
03_multiple_ssh_reacheable_machines
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ figures
â”œâ”€â”€ launch_entry.py
â””â”€â”€ multi_launch.py
```

Where the main file contains the following

```python
import jaynes

def train_fn():
    from time import sleep

    for i in range(10):
        print(f"step: {i}"); sleep(0.1)
    print('Finished!')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    jaynes.config(verbose=False)
    jaynes.run(train_fn)

    jaynes.listen(200)
```

### Mode 1: Plain Password

Set the following environment parameters in your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
export JYNS_USERNAME=/*your username*/
export JYNS_PASSWORD='/*your password*/'  # use '' if contain [!]
export JYNS_DIR=/*path to the NFS you have access to*/
```

### Mode 2: Private Key

If you access the machine using a privte key instead change the `.jaynes.yml` file by replacing the `host.password` field with `host.pem: /*path to your pem key*/;` instead.

```yaml
  vision01: &vision01
    ip: vision01
    username: "{env.JYNS_USERNAME}"
    # remove this line from the config file
    # password: "{env.JYNS_PASSWORD}"
    pem: ~/.ssh/your-public-key
    launch_dir: {env.JYNS_DIR}/jaynes-demo/{now:%Y-%m-%d}/{now:%H%M%S.%f}
```

## Managing Python Environments on Server

Setup a conda environment on the server, and then install jaynes in that python environment: we use `jaynes.entry` module to bootstrap the python runtime. In this example, we use the `base` environment that comes with each conda installation.

```bash
conda activate base
pip install jaynes
```

The launch `.jaynes.yml` file contains the following values for configuring the remote python runtime:

```yaml
setup: |
  . $HOME/lfgr.env
  conda activate base
envs: >-
  LANG=utf-8
  LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.mujoco/mujoco200/bin:$LD_LIBREARY_PATH
  PYTHONPATH=`which python`:$PYTHONPATH
pypath: "{mounts[0].host_path}"
work_dir: "{mounts[0].host_path}"
```

## Overriding the Config File \(and Launch Across Machines\)

In the [./multi\_launch.py](https://github.com/geyang/practical-rl-at-scale/tree/885c3305a903870fbdd48d09444c038d5f02c605/03_multiple_ssh_reacheable_machines/multi_launch.py) script, we automatically distribute the launch across multiple machines. This script shows the pattern for overwriding the configuration file:

```python
#! ./multi_launch.py
import jaynes
from launch_entry import train_fn

if __name__ == "__main__":
    for i in range(3):
        jaynes.config(verbose=False, runner=dict(host=f"vision{i:02d}"))
        jaynes.run(train_fn)

    jaynes.listen(200)
```

You should see the output stream from all three machines combined in the stdout.

## On Running Tensorflow

In rare occations \(for example at CSAIL\), if you install tensorflow via `pip` sometimes it gives `Illegal Instructions` fault during import. If this happens for any reason, you should switch to a conda installation. This nasty issue raises its head here and [there](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/40978) without a clear solution except the following:

**First, make sure you remove tensorflow from everywhere possible**. This includes `~/.local`, **and** your conda's `site-packages`. \(some times it is installed at both locations\). After manually checking for these locations, install using conda. Note that conda installation can be quite slow:

```bash
yes | pip uninstall tensorflow
conda install --use-local tensorflow=2.3.1  # notice only one "="
```
